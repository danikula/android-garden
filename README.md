## Why android-garden?
Because android ideas germinate, grow and die here like trees in garden.

## How to use?
Just add link to repository and dependency:
```
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/alexeydanilov/maven' }
}
dependencies {
    compile 'com.danikula:android-garden:2.0.12'
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:22.1.1'
    compile 'com.google.guava:guava-jdk5:17.0'
}
```
See `sample` app for details.
